## Mission Statement (Initial Vision Statement)

**For** veterans across the country **who** are in need of some form of benefit support, **the** current system is complicated at best. This current system **is** layered in bureaucracy **that** slows the entire process downs and can even discourage veterans from even seeking support. Fortunately the United States government and the Department of Veteran's Affairs has recognized this is a problem. Working with several companies, they have created several API's to ease developers in building applications to help veterans around the country. **Unlike** the vast majority of applications out there, **our application** will be one of the few that isn't completely government based, and will have more features than to call for more information.
