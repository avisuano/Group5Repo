# #**T**eam**V**eteran**S**upport

## Mission Statement (Initial Vision Statement)

**For** veterans across the country **who** are in need of some form of benefit support, **the** current system is complicated at best. This current system **is** layered in bureaucracy **that** slows the entire process down and can even discourage veterans from seeking support. Fortunately, the United States government and the Department of Veteran's Affairs has recognized this is a problem. Working with several companies, they have created several API's to ease developers in building applications to help veterans around the country. **Unlike** the vast majority of applications out there, **our application** will be one of the few that isn't completely government based, and will have more features than to just call for more information.

## Early Needs and Features
1. Clean, simple, and easy to navigate web application.
2. Ability for users to create accounts.
3. Forums boards for questions.
4. The ability to search the boards for a specific question or topic.
5. Find VA facilities near by (Google Maps API and VA Facility API).
6. An in depth about/why page for civilians and family members who would like to help further.

## How These will be implemented.
The first feature is pretty self explanatory. Account creation will be used so users can use forum board, as well as save results from VA facility search. The forums implementation will be stored in a database that will keep track of the date posted, user who posted, title, and post body. The user that created the forum or post will be able to edit or delete their own posts. Admin accounts will be able manage the forum, and will be able to delete posts as needed. Because the forums are stored on a database, users will be able to search for a specific topic or post that they like to read up on. Any visitor will be able to search for a VA facility, logged in users will be able to save specific searches to their account. The in depth about page, will be an interactive experience were family, friends and civilians can learn more about each branch and the role they serve in the United States military, and how they can help support veterans.
